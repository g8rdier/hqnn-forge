hqnn_forge.preprocessing
========================
Classical pre-processing pipeline — PCA dimensionality reduction and feature
standardisation — implemented in pure NumPy (no scikit-learn runtime dependency).

Exported symbols
----------------
PCANormalizer     Fits/applies PCA + per-feature standardisation; returns torch.Tensor.
stratified_kfold  Fold indices that keep class prevalence.
smote             SMOTE oversampling of a binary minority class.
oversample_fold   SMOTE one fold's training rows only; validation rows untouched.
iter_folds        Stratified folds with fold-safe oversampling.
Fold, SmoteResult Result types of the above.
